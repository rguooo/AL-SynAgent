Explanation and Advice for the Reported ALERTS
================================================================================

================================================================================
ALERT_002 Type_2 Indicator that the Structure Model may be Wrong or Deficient.
================================================================================
 This ALERT reports the number of atomic sites that are flagged as distance     
 or angle restrained (D-Flag)                                                   

================================================================================
ALERT_003 Type_2 Indicator that the Structure Model may be Wrong or Deficient.
================================================================================
 This ALERT reports the number of non-H atoms that are flagged as handled       
 with Uiso or Uij restraints (U-Flag)                                           

================================================================================
ALERT_004 Type_5 Informative Message, Check.                                  
================================================================================
 This ALERT reports on polymeric networks and their dimensionality as found in  
 the crystal structure.                                                         
 Note: Polymeric structures can be legitimate or due to an erroneous            
 structure analysis.                                                            

================================================================================
ALERT_033 Type_4 Improvement, Methodology, Query or Suggestion.               
================================================================================
 Check the relevance/validity of the absolute structure determination. Please   
 refer to Flack,H.D. & Bernardinelli, G. (1999) Acta Cryst. A55, 908-915 and    
 (2000) J. Appl. Cryst., 33, 1143-1148. A value of the Flack parameter that     
 deviates significantly from zero  (taking into account the associated s.u.)    
 might indicate that the absolute structure should be inverted in case of a     
 value closer to 1.0 than to zero. A value close to 0.5 may be indicative of    
 an inversion twin or a missed centre of inversion. For valid absolute          
 structure assignments, abs(x) should be less than 2 * s.u., with s.u. < 0.04.  
 For enantiopure compounds, s.u. should be less than 0.1.                       

================================================================================
ALERT_040 Type_1 CIF Construction/Syntax Error, Inconsistent or Missing Data. 
================================================================================
 Alert for 'no H-atoms' in CIF. This is unusual for carbon containing           
 compounds, but may be correct.                                                 

================================================================================
ALERT_072 Type_2 Indicator that the Structure Model may be Wrong or Deficient.
================================================================================
 The first parameter on the SHELXL weighting line has an exceptionally          
 large value. This may indicate either improper reflection s.u.'s or            
 an unresolved problem such as missed twinning.                                 

================================================================================
ALERT_083 Type_2 Indicator that the Structure Model may be Wrong or Deficient.
================================================================================
 The second parameter on the SHELXL weighting line has an exceptionally large   
 value. This may indicate either improper reflection s.u.s or an unresolved     
 problem such as missed twinning.                                               

================================================================================
ALERT_172 Type_4 Improvement, Methodology, Query or Suggestion.               
================================================================================
 The use of DFIX record(s) should be documented in the experimental section     
 of the associated publication.                                                 

================================================================================
ALERT_173 Type_4 Improvement, Methodology, Query or Suggestion.               
================================================================================
 The use of DANG record(s) should be documented in the experimental section     
 of the associated publication.                                                 

================================================================================
ALERT_178 Type_4 Improvement, Methodology, Query or Suggestion.               
================================================================================
 The use of SIMU record(s) in the SHELXL .res file should be documented in the  
 experimental section of the associated publication.                            

================================================================================
ALERT_186 Type_4 Improvement, Methodology, Query or Suggestion.               
================================================================================
 The use of ISOR record(s) in the SHELXL .res file should be documented in the  
 experimental section of the associated publication.                            

================================================================================
ALERT_231 Type_4 Improvement, Methodology, Query or Suggestion.               
================================================================================
 The components of the anisotropic displacement parameters along chemical       
 bonds are assumed to be equal in magnitude. Large differences might            
 indicate the contamination of these parameters with other (unresolved) effects 
 such as (substitutional) disorder, model or data errors and/or                 
 over-refinement. Atomic sites assigned the wrong scattering type (e.g. Ag      
 versus Br) should generate 'problem signals' with this test. Data sets         
 corrected for absorption effects with DELREF techniques (e.g. DIFABS, SHELXA,  
 XABS2) often show large DELU values for bonds involving the heaviest atom.     
 Note: The original 'Hirshfeld-test' was defined in absolute terms (see         
 F.L.Hirshfeld, Acta Cryst. (1976). A32, 239-244). The current test is with     
 reference to the associated standard uncertainty.                              

================================================================================
ALERT_234 Type_4 Improvement, Methodology, Query or Suggestion.               
================================================================================

================================================================================
ALERT_241 Type_2 Indicator that the Structure Model may be Wrong or Deficient.
================================================================================
 The U(eq) value of an atom is compared with the average U(eq) for to           
 non-hydrogen atoms bonded to it. Large differences may indicate that the       
 wrong atom type was assigned (e.g. N instead of O).                            

================================================================================
ALERT_242 Type_2 Indicator that the Structure Model may be Wrong or Deficient.
================================================================================
 The U(eq) value of an atom is compared with the average U(eq) for              
 non-hydrogen atoms bonded to it. Large differences may indicate that the       
 wrong atom type was assigned (e.g. N instead of O). False alarms may           
 occur for terminal groups such as the t-butyl moiety.                          

================================================================================
ALERT_243 Type_4 Improvement, Methodology, Query or Suggestion.               
================================================================================
 The U(eq) value of an atom in the solvent or ion is compared with the average  
 U(eq) for non-hydrogen atoms bonded to it. Large differences may indicate      
 that the wrong atom type was assigned (e.g. N instead of O).                   

================================================================================
ALERT_244 Type_4 Improvement, Methodology, Query or Suggestion.               
================================================================================
 The U(eq) value of an atom in the solvent or ion is compared with the average  
 U(eq) for non-hydrogen atoms bonded to it. Large differences may indicate      
 that the wrong atom type was assigned (e.g. N instead of O). False alarms may  
 occur for terminal groups such as the t-butyl moiety.                          

================================================================================
ALERT_260 Type_2 Indicator that the Structure Model may be Wrong or Deficient.
================================================================================
 A large average Ueq value for a residue may indicate refinement with a too     
 high (possibly fixed) population parameter value.                              

================================================================================
ALERT_301 Type_3 Indicator that the Structure Quality may be Low.             
================================================================================
 Atom sites that are not fully occupied are counted. A large fraction of        
 disordered atoms may be both a signal for serious structure analysis           
 problems or less reliable/interesting results.                                 

================================================================================
ALERT_342 Type_3 Indicator that the Structure Quality may be Low.             
================================================================================
 The average s.u. for X-Y bonds is tested (named bond-precision). X-Y will      
 generally be C-C bonds, unless there are none. In the last case the s.u.'s of  
 the lowest element numbers are considered (excluding hydrogen). There are      
 three test ranges: one for structures with the largest element Z < 20, one     
 for the largest Z in the range 20 to 39 and one for structures with Z(max) 40  
 or higher (_340, _341 and _342 respectively)                                   

================================================================================
ALERT_431 Type_2 Indicator that the Structure Model may be Wrong or Deficient.
================================================================================
 This test reports on short intermolecular Halogen .. Donor/Acceptor            
 atom-type distances.                                                           

================================================================================
ALERT_432 Type_2 Indicator that the Structure Model may be Wrong or Deficient.
================================================================================
 This test raised an ALERT for short intermolecular contacts.                   
 In general, intermolecular contact distances should be not much smaller than   
 the sum of the associated van der Waals Radii. More often than not, such       
 short contacts can be a warning sign for errors. All short contacts should     
 therefore be examined in some detail. Interesting exceptions are carbonyl-     
 carbonyl interactions that often feature short O...C contacts (see Allen       
 et al. (1998) B54, 320-329, short NO2 O...O interactions and BF4(-) to         
 (aromatic) carbon contacts.                                                    

================================================================================
ALERT_601 Type_2 Indicator that the Structure Model may be Wrong or Deficient.
================================================================================
 Crystal structures in general do not contain large solvent accessible voids    
 in the lattice. Most structures lose their long-range ordering when solvent    
 molecules leave the crystal. Only when the remaining network is strongly       
 bonded (e.g. zeolites and some hydrogen bonded networks) the crystal           
 structure may survive.                                                         
 Residual voids in a structure may indicate the omission of (disordered)        
 density from the model. Disordered density may go undetected when smeared      
 since peak search programs are not designed to locate maxima on density        
 ridges. The presence or absence of residual density in the void may be         
 verified on a printed/plotted difference Fourier map or with PLATON/SQUEEZE.   
 Voids of 40 Ang**3 may accommodate H2O. Small molecules such as                
 Tetrahydrofuran have typical volumes in the 100 to 200 Ang**3 range.           
 This test reports the volume of the largest solvent accessible void in the     
 structure.                                                                     
 A paper reporting a crystal structure with a significant solvent accessible    
 void should at the least discuss the issue.                                    

================================================================================
ALERT_860 Type_3 Indicator that the Structure Quality may be Low.             
================================================================================
 The use of restraints used in the refinement should be explained in            
 the write-up of a structure analysis.                                          
                                                                                
 It is also recommended to include the refinement instructions in the           
 CIF (e.g. the final .res of a SHELXL refinement) as a comment:                 
 _iucr_refine_instructions_details                                              
 ;                                                                              
 TITL                                                                           
 ..                                                                             
 (etc.)                                                                         
 ;                                                                              
                                                                                
 Note: An exception are restraints for floating origins (e.g. in P21).          

================================================================================
ALERT_910 Type_3 Indicator that the Structure Quality may be Low.             
================================================================================
 Possible causes: Experimental beamstop Theta(min) limit set too high; A large  
 unit-cell causing reflections effected by the beamstop. A possible technical   
 solution on CCD based equipment involves the collection of additional images   
 with the detector at a larger distance from the crystal with the beamstop      
 setting changed accordingly. Alternatively, a large number of low-order        
 'outlier' reflections might have been 'Omitted' deliberately from the (final)  
 least-squares refinement. The test is against the actual Theta(Min) of the     
 reflections in the *.fcf file. See the *.ckf file for details of the missing   
 reflections. Good quality low order reflections might be relevant for SQUEEZE  
 and similar solvent modelling refinement techniques.                           

================================================================================
ALERT_911 Type_3 Indicator that the Structure Quality may be Low.             
================================================================================
 Possible causes: Missing cusp of data (due to rotation about one axis),        
 deleted (overflow) reflections or improper strategy (orthorhombic for          
 monoclinic crystal etc.) See the .ckf file for details.                        

================================================================================
ALERT_912 Type_4 Improvement, Methodology, Query or Suggestion.               
================================================================================
 Possible causes: Missing cusp of data (due to rotation about one axis),        
 deleted (overflow) reflections or improper strategy (orthorhombic for          
 monoclinic crystal etc.) See the .ckf file for details.                        

================================================================================
ALERT_933 Type_2 Indicator that the Structure Model may be Wrong or Deficient.
================================================================================
 This ALERT reports on the number of 'OMIT h k l' records (Reflections          
 omitted from the least-squares refinement) in the CIF embedded .res file.      
 Generally, there should be a good reason for excluding those observed          
 experimental data point such as (partial) obscuration by the beam stop.        

================================================================================
ALERT_971 Type_2 Indicator that the Structure Model may be Wrong or Deficient.
================================================================================
 Larger than expected residual density maximum outside metal atom locations.    
 This might be caused by unaccounted for twinning, wrongly assigned             
 atom types, unaccounted for solvent and other model errors.                    

================================================================================
ALERT_972 Type_2 Indicator that the Structure Model may be Wrong or Deficient.
================================================================================
 Larger than expected residual density minimum outside metal atom locations.    
 This might be caused by unaccounted for twinning, wrongly assigned             
 atom types and other model errors.                                             

================================================================================
ALERT_973 Type_2 Indicator that the Structure Model may be Wrong or Deficient.
================================================================================
 Larger than expected residual density maximum on metal atom location.          
 This might be caused by unaccounted for twinning, wrongly assigned             
 atom types and other model errors.                                             
 Another cause may be a SHELXL 'DAMP 0 0' instruction for a non-converged       
 refinement.                                                                    

================================================================================
ALERT_975 Type_2 Indicator that the Structure Model may be Wrong or Deficient.
================================================================================
 Positive density found in a difference density map at a position               
 within bonding distance for a hydrogen atom from a nitrogen or oxygen          
 atom. A possible reason can be a missing hydrogen atom. Also check for         
 tautomerism.                                                                   

================================================================================
ALERT_976 Type_2 Indicator that the Structure Model may be Wrong or Deficient.
================================================================================
 Negative density found in a difference density map at a location               
 within bonding distance for a hydrogen atom from a nitrogen or oxygen          
 atom. A possible reason can be a misassigned hydrogen atom. Also check for     
 tautomerism.                                                                   

================================================================================
ALERT_978 Type_2 Indicator that the Structure Model may be Wrong or Deficient.
================================================================================
 Difference density maps generally show residual densities on C-C bonds.        
 A significant number of those may indicate good data. Cases where this number  
 is zero should be investigated for a reason. The use of aspherical scattering  
 factors in the refinement model may be one.
