Explanation and Advice for the Reported ALERTS
================================================================================

================================================================================
ALERT_002 Type_2 Indicator that the Structure Model may be Wrong or Deficient.
================================================================================
 This ALERT reports the number of atomic sites that are flagged as distance     
 or angle restrained (D-Flag)                                                   

================================================================================
ALERT_003 Type_2 Indicator that the Structure Model may be Wrong or Deficient.
================================================================================
 This ALERT reports the number of non-H atoms that are flagged as handled       
 with Uiso or Uij restraints (U-Flag)                                           

================================================================================
ALERT_004 Type_5 Informative Message, Check.                                  
================================================================================
 This ALERT reports on polymeric networks and their dimensionality as found in  
 the crystal structure.                                                         
 Note: Polymeric structures can be legitimate or due to an erroneous            
 structure analysis.                                                            

================================================================================
ALERT_007 Type_5 Informative Message, Check.                                  
================================================================================
 It is standard practice to refine Hydrogen atoms on hetero atoms as proof of   
 their correct assignment.                                                      

================================================================================
ALERT_020 Type_3 Indicator that the Structure Quality may be Low.             
================================================================================
 The value of Rint (i.e. _diffrn_reflns_av_R_equivalents) should normally be    
 considerably less than 0.12 and in the order of magnitude of the reported      
 R-values. Rint may be relatively meaningless when based on a very limited      
 number of averaged data. Higher values should be accompanied by a suitable     
 explanation in the _publ_section_exptl_refinement section. However,            
 authors should first ensure that there are not overlooked problems             
 associated with the data or the space-group. Elevated values for               
 _diffrn_reflns_av_R_equivalents may be indicative of a need to recollect       
 the data from a crystal of higher quality or that there is a problem with      
 the data treatment. Consider the following                                     
 (a) The absorption corrections are inadequate or inappropriate.                
 (b) The overall quality of the data may be poor due to the crystal quality.    
 (c) The crystal is very weakly diffracting, so that a large proportion of      
     essentially "unobserved" reflections are being used in the refinement.     
     You should consider using a better crystal or a data collection at         
     low temperature and/or, if the compound is organic, using Cu radiation.    
 (d) You are working in the wrong crystal system or Laue group.                 
 (e) You have only a very small number of equivalent reflections, which         
     may lead to artificially high values of _diffrn_reflns_av_R_equivalents    
                                                                                
 Note that if _diffrn_reflns_av_sigmaI/netI is also large, the quality          
 of the data should be considered to be suspect.                                

================================================================================
ALERT_033 Type_4 Improvement, Methodology, Query or Suggestion.               
================================================================================
 Check the relevance/validity of the absolute structure determination. Please   
 refer to Flack,H.D. & Bernardinelli, G. (1999) Acta Cryst. A55, 908-915 and    
 (2000) J. Appl. Cryst., 33, 1143-1148. A value of the Flack parameter that     
 deviates significantly from zero  (taking into account the associated s.u.)    
 might indicate that the absolute structure should be inverted in case of a     
 value closer to 1.0 than to zero. A value close to 0.5 may be indicative of    
 an inversion twin or a missed centre of inversion. For valid absolute          
 structure assignments, abs(x) should be less than 2 * s.u., with s.u. < 0.04.  
 For enantiopure compounds, s.u. should be less than 0.1.                       

================================================================================
ALERT_072 Type_2 Indicator that the Structure Model may be Wrong or Deficient.
================================================================================
 The first parameter on the SHELXL weighting line has an exceptionally          
 large value. This may indicate either improper reflection s.u.'s or            
 an unresolved problem such as missed twinning.                                 

================================================================================
ALERT_084 Type_3 Indicator that the Structure Quality may be Low.             
================================================================================
 wR2 will in general have a value twice of that of R1 with refinement on F**2.  
 Significantly larger values usually indicate a poor refinement model.          
 Also check for unaccounted for twinning.                                       

================================================================================
ALERT_090 Type_3 Indicator that the Structure Quality may be Low.             
================================================================================
 The data/parameter ratio should in general be higher than 8 for a quality      
 determination for a structure containing heavy atoms with ZMAX greater         
 than 17. This ratio can be improved by not refining C-H parameters other       
 than riding on their carrier atom.                                             

================================================================================
ALERT_168 Type_4 Improvement, Methodology, Query or Suggestion.               
================================================================================
 The use of EXYZ record(s) in the SHELXL .res file should be documented in the  
 experimental section of the associated publication.                            

================================================================================
ALERT_171 Type_4 Improvement, Methodology, Query or Suggestion.               
================================================================================
 The use of EADP record(s) in the SHELXL .res file should be documented in the  
 experimental section of the associated publication.                            

================================================================================
ALERT_172 Type_4 Improvement, Methodology, Query or Suggestion.               
================================================================================
 The use of DFIX record(s) should be documented in the experimental section     
 of the associated publication.                                                 

================================================================================
ALERT_173 Type_4 Improvement, Methodology, Query or Suggestion.               
================================================================================
 The use of DANG record(s) should be documented in the experimental section     
 of the associated publication.                                                 

================================================================================
ALERT_177 Type_4 Improvement, Methodology, Query or Suggestion.               
================================================================================
 The use of DELU record(s) in the SHELXL .res file should be documented in the  
 experimental section of the associated publication.                            

================================================================================
ALERT_178 Type_4 Improvement, Methodology, Query or Suggestion.               
================================================================================
 The use of SIMU record(s) in the SHELXL .res file should be documented in the  
 experimental section of the associated publication.                            

================================================================================
ALERT_186 Type_4 Improvement, Methodology, Query or Suggestion.               
================================================================================
 The use of ISOR record(s) in the SHELXL .res file should be documented in the  
 experimental section of the associated publication.                            

================================================================================
ALERT_213 Type_2 Indicator that the Structure Model may be Wrong or Deficient.
================================================================================
 The main axes values of the ADP(S) of the main residue(s) are determined and   
 ordered: U1 < U2 < U3. The value of SQRT(U3/U1) main axis ADP ratio (Angstrom  
 Units) is tested for the main residue(s). Large values may indicate unresolved 
 disorder. Oblate criterium: U3 - U2 < U2 - U1. Prolate otherwise.              

================================================================================
ALERT_232 Type_2 Indicator that the Structure Model may be Wrong or Deficient.
================================================================================
 The components of the anisotropic displacement parameters along chemical       
 bonds are assumed to be equal in magnitude. Large differences might            
 indicate contamination of these parameters with other (unresolved) effects     
 such as (substitutional) disorder, model or data errors and/or                 
 over-refinement. Atomic sites assigned the wrong scattering type (e.g. Ag      
 versus Br) should generate 'problem signals' with this test. Data sets         
 corrected for absorption effects with DELREF techniques (e.g. DIFABS, SHELXA,  
 XABS2) often show large DELU values for bonds involving the heaviest atom.     
                                                                                
 A special case are M-C=O type of systems that generally show significant       
 differences for the M-C bond. See D.Braga & T.F. Koetzle (1988), Acta Cryst.   
 B44, 151-155).                                                                 
                                                                                
 Note: The original 'Hirshfeld-test' was defined in absolute terms (see         
 F.L.Hirshfeld, Acta Cryst. (1976). A32, 239-244). The current test is with     
 reference to the associated standard uncertainty.                              
                                                                                
 Note: The 'Hirshfeld-test' ALERTS are suppressed for polymeric or disordered   
 structures.                                                                    

================================================================================
ALERT_234 Type_4 Improvement, Methodology, Query or Suggestion.               
================================================================================
 The components of the anisotropic displacement parameters along chemical       
 bonds are assumed to be equal in magnitude. Large differences might            
 indicate contamination of these parameters with other (unresolved) effects     
 such as (substitutional) disorder, model or data errors and/or

================================================================================
ALERT_241 Type_2 Indicator that the Structure Model may be Wrong or Deficient.
================================================================================
 The U(eq) value of an atom is compared with the average U(eq) for to           
 non-hydrogen atoms bonded to it. Large differences may indicate that the       
 wrong atom type was assigned (e.g. N instead of O).                            

================================================================================
ALERT_242 Type_2 Indicator that the Structure Model may be Wrong or Deficient.
================================================================================
 The U(eq) value of an atom is compared with the average U(eq) for              
 non-hydrogen atoms bonded to it. Large differences may indicate that the       
 wrong atom type was assigned (e.g. N instead of O). False alarms may           
 occur for terminal groups such as the t-butyl moiety.                          

================================================================================
ALERT_250 Type_2 Indicator that the Structure Model may be Wrong or Deficient.
================================================================================
 An average value of the U(i,j) tensor of the asymmetric unit of a residue      
 is calculated. An ALERT is generated when the corresponding U3/U1 ratio        
 deviates significantly from 1.0. Large values of this ratio should be taken    
 as an indication of possible systematic errors in the data or errors in        
 the model. Visual inspection of an ORTEP plot will show that many              
 displacement ellipsoids have their major axis pointing in the same direction.  

================================================================================
ALERT_260 Type_2 Indicator that the Structure Model may be Wrong or Deficient.
================================================================================
 A large average Ueq value for a residue may indicate refinement with a too     
 high (possibly fixed) population parameter value.                              

================================================================================
ALERT_300 Type_4 Improvement, Methodology, Query or Suggestion.               
================================================================================
 This site is expected to be fully occupied but has been constrained (e.g.      
 with a SHELXL FVAR variable) or fixed at a value less than 1.0. Please check   
 for incomplete (substitutional) disorder handling.                             

================================================================================
ALERT_301 Type_3 Indicator that the Structure Quality may be Low.             
================================================================================
 Atom sites that are not fully occupied are counted. A large fraction of        
 disordered atoms may be both a signal for serious structure analysis           
 problems or less reliable/interesting results.                                 

================================================================================
ALERT_342 Type_3 Indicator that the Structure Quality may be Low.             
================================================================================
 The average s.u. for X-Y bonds is tested (named bond-precision). X-Y will      
 generally be C-C bonds, unless there are none. In the last case the s.u.'s of  
 the lowest element numbers are considered (excluding hydrogen). There are      
 three test ranges: one for structures with the largest element Z < 20, one     
 for the largest Z in the range 20 to 39 and one for structures with Z(max) 40  
 or higher (_340, _341 and _342 respectively)                                   

================================================================================
ALERT_360 Type_2 Indicator that the Structure Model may be Wrong or Deficient.
================================================================================
 Large deviations from generally accepted values may indicate model problems,   
 over refinement etc. Default C4-C4 = 1.54 Ang. (X-Ray) value from              
 Ladd & Palmer, Structure Determination by Xray Crystallography (1985).         
 Note:                                                                          
  - C4-C4 indicates a bond between atoms with 4 bonds each.                     

================================================================================
ALERT_395 Type_2 Indicator that the Structure Model may be Wrong or Deficient.
================================================================================
 The X-O-Y angle value differs from the common ~120.0 Degrees.                  

================================================================================
ALERT_410 Type_2 Indicator that the Structure Model may be Wrong or Deficient.
================================================================================
 Short intramolecular contacts may arise when H-atoms are in (false)            
 calculated positions. Short intramolecular contacts may also be a sign for a   
 false structure with the molecule sitting on a site with improper site         
 symmetry (e.g. '2' instead of '-1') which may happen when a lattice            
 translation is missed. Short contacts are defined using a van der Waals        
 radius of 1.2 Angstrom. For intramolecular contacts alerts are generated       
 for contacts less than 2.0 Angstrom.                                           

================================================================================
ALERT_431 Type_2 Indicator that the Structure Model may be Wrong or Deficient.
================================================================================
 This test reports on short intermolecular Halogen .. Donor/Acceptor            
 atom-type distances.                                                           

================================================================================
ALERT_432 Type_2 Indicator that the Structure Model may be Wrong or Deficient.
================================================================================
 This test raised an ALERT for short intermolecular contacts.                   
 In general, intermolecular contact distances should be not much smaller than   
 the sum of the associated van der Waals Radii. More often than not, such       
 short contacts can be a warning sign for errors. All short contacts should     
 therefore be examined in some detail. Interesting exceptions are carbonyl-     
 carbonyl interactions that often feature short O...C contacts (see Allen       
 et al. (1998) B54, 320-329, short NO2 O...O interactions and BF4(-) to         
 (aromatic) carbon contacts.

================================================================================
 Possibly erroneous (Bond)angle less than 45 degree. The angle might be         
 considered for elimination from the CIF when irrelevant. This ALERT can        
 also be triggered when the assigned occupancy factors are incorrect.           

================================================================================
ALERT_860 Type_3 Indicator that the Structure Quality may be Low.             
================================================================================
 The use of restraints used in the refinement should be explained in            
 the write-up of a structure analysis.                                          
                                                                                
 It is also recommended to include the refinement instructions in the           
 CIF (e.g. the final .res of a SHELXL refinement) as a comment:

 Please supply the proper info for _atom_site_solution_primary. Values must     
 be one of the following: difmap, vecmap, heavy, direct, geom, disper, isomor,  
 notdet, dual, iterative, other.

ALERT_907 Type_2 Indicator that the Structure Model may be Wrong or Deficient.
================================================================================
 A Flack x value generally indicates that the structure needs to be inverted.   
 Check whether the Flack x value is unreliable due to a weak anomalous          
 dispersion signal, systematic errors or weak data and against know absolute    
 structure.

ALERT_910 Type_3 Indicator that the Structure Quality may be Low.             
================================================================================
 Possible causes: Experimental beamstop Theta(min) limit set too high; A large  
 unit-cell causing reflections effected by the beamstop. A possible technical   
 solution on CCD based equipment involves the collection of additional images   
 with the detector at a larger distance from the crystal with the beamstop      
 setting changed accordingly. Alternatively, a large number of low-order        
 'outlier' reflections might have been 'Omitted' deliberately from the (final)  
 least-squares refinement. The test is against the actual Theta(Min) of the     
 reflections in the *.fcf file. See the *.ckf file for details of the missing   
 reflections. Good quality low order reflections might be relevant for SQUEEZE  
 and similar solvent modelling refinement techniques.

ALERT_912 Type_4 Improvement, Methodology, Query or Suggestion.               
================================================================================
 Possible causes: Missing cusp of data (due to rotation about one axis),        
 deleted (overflow) reflections or improper strategy (orthorhombic for          
 monoclinic crystal etc.) See the .ckf file for details.

 The Hooft y Parameter is calculated independently from the Bijvoet             
 differences and should have a value similar (observing the s.u.'s) to that of  
 the Flack x Parameter. See:

 Large differences may arise in cases where the Flack parameter was not         
 done with BASF/TWIN or with essentially centrosymmetric data.

ALERT_936 Type_2 Indicator that the Structure Model may be Wrong or Deficient.
================================================================================
 The reason for the use of a DAMP instruction in the final refinement job       
 should be discussed/reported. 'DAMP 0.0' should not be used for small          
 molecule refinement since it masks non-convergence.

ALERT_972 Type_2 Indicator that the Structure Model may be Wrong or Deficient.
================================================================================
 Larger than expected residual density minimum outside metal atom locations.    
 This might be caused by unaccounted for twinning, wrongly assigned             
 atom types and other model errors.                                             

================================================================================
ALERT_973 Type_2 Indicator that the Structure Model may be Wrong or Deficient.
================================================================================
 Larger than expected residual density maximum on metal atom location.          
 This might be caused by unaccounted for twinning, wrongly assigned             
 atom types and other model errors.                                             
 Another cause may be a SHELXL 'DAMP 0 0' instruction for a non-converged       
 refinement.

 Negative density found in a difference density map at a H-atom location.       
 A reason might be an incorrect AFIX instruction.                               

================================================================================
ALERT_978 Type_2 Indicator that the Structure Model may be Wrong or Deficient.
================================================================================
 Difference density maps generally show residual densities on C-C bonds.        
 A significant number of those may indicate good data. Cases where this number  
 is zero should be investigated for a reason. The use of aspherical scattering  
 factors in the refinement model may be one.
