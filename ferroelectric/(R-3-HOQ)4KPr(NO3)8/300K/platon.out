Explanation and Advice for the Reported ALERTS
================================================================================

================================================================================
ALERT_002 Type_2 Indicator that the Structure Model may be Wrong or Deficient.
================================================================================
 This ALERT reports the number of atomic sites that are flagged as distance     
 or angle restrained (D-Flag)                                                   

================================================================================
ALERT_003 Type_2 Indicator that the Structure Model may be Wrong or Deficient.
================================================================================
 This ALERT reports the number of non-H atoms that are flagged as handled       
 with Uiso or Uij restraints (U-Flag)                                           

================================================================================
ALERT_004 Type_5 Informative Message, Check.                                  
================================================================================
 This ALERT reports on polymeric networks and their dimensionality as found in  
 the crystal structure.                                                         
 Note: Polymeric structures can be legitimate or due to an erroneous            
 structure analysis.                                                            

================================================================================
ALERT_007 Type_5 Informative Message, Check.                                  
================================================================================
 It is standard practice to refine Hydrogen atoms on hetero atoms as proof of   
 their correct assignment.                                                      

================================================================================
ALERT_042 Type_1 CIF Construction/Syntax Error, Inconsistent or Missing Data. 
================================================================================
 In the ideal case, the MoietyFormula string as reported should be identical    
 to the MoietyFormula string calculated from the data in the CIF. If not, the   
 reason should be clear. Examples are cases where there is no separating space  
 between two element names or cases where populations do not add up to          
 integer numbers or when moieties are separated by '.' instead of ','.          
                                                                                
 Example: NO3 should be given as N O3                                           
                                                                                
 Note: Alerts _041, _042 & _045 can probably be ignored when the relevant       
 values differ by the same factor.                                              

================================================================================
ALERT_090 Type_3 Indicator that the Structure Quality may be Low.             
================================================================================
 The data/parameter ratio should in general be higher than 8 for a quality      
 determination for a structure containing heavy atoms with ZMAX greater         
 than 17. This ratio can be improved by not refining C-H parameters other       
 than riding on their carrier atom.                                             

================================================================================
ALERT_094 Type_2 Indicator that the Structure Model may be Wrong or Deficient.
================================================================================
 The ratio of the maximum and minimum residual density excursions is            
 unusual. This might indicate unaccounted for twinning or missing atoms         
 (e.g. associated with disordered solvent).                                     

================================================================================
ALERT_115 Type_5 Informative Message, Check.                                  
================================================================================
 Tests for missed symmetry are done with ADDSYM, an expanded MISSYM (C)         
 clone. This ALERT reports on local inversion symmetry, not compatible          
 with the reported space-group symmetry.                                        
 Note: H-atoms and disordered atoms are not taken into account in the test.     

================================================================================
ALERT_168 Type_4 Improvement, Methodology, Query or Suggestion.               
================================================================================
 The use of EXYZ record(s) in the SHELXL .res file should be documented in the  
 experimental section of the associated publication.                            

================================================================================
ALERT_171 Type_4 Improvement, Methodology, Query or Suggestion.               
================================================================================
 The use of EADP record(s) in the SHELXL .res file should be documented in the  
 experimental section of the associated publication.                            

================================================================================
ALERT_172 Type_4 Improvement, Methodology, Query or Suggestion.               
================================================================================
 The use of DFIX record(s) should be documented in the experimental section     
 of the associated publication.                                                 

================================================================================
ALERT_173 Type_4 Improvement, Methodology, Query or Suggestion.               
================================================================================
 The use of DANG record(s) should be documented in the experimental section     
 of the associated publication.                                                 

================================================================================
ALERT_178 Type_4 Improvement, Methodology, Query or Suggestion.               
================================================================================
 The use of SIMU record(s) in the SHELXL .res file should be documented in the  
 experimental section of the associated publication.                            

================================================================================
ALERT_232 Type_2 Indicator that the Structure Model may be Wrong or Deficient.
================================================================================
 The components of the anisotropic displacement parameters along chemical       
 bonds are assumed to be equal in magnitude. Large differences might            
 indicate contamination of these parameters with other (unresolved) effects     
 such as (substitutional) disorder, model or data errors and/or                 
 over-refinement. Atomic sites assigned the wrong scattering type (e.g. Ag      
 versus Br) should generate 'problem signals' with this test. Data sets         
 corrected for absorption effects with DELREF techniques (e.g. DIFABS, SHELXA,  
 XABS2) often show large DELU values for bonds involving the heaviest atom.     
                                                                                
 A special case are M-C=O type of systems that generally show significant       
 differences for the M-C bond. See D.Braga & T.F. Koetzle (1988), Acta Cryst.   
 B44, 151-155).                                                                 
                                                                                
 Note: The original 'Hirshfeld-test' was defined in absolute terms (see         
 F.L.Hirshfeld, Acta Cryst. (1976). A32, 239-244). The current test is with     
 reference to the associated standard uncertainty.                              
                                                                                
 Note: The 'Hirshfeld-test' ALERTS are suppressed for polymeric or disordered   
 structures.                                                                    

================================================================================
ALERT_234 Type_4 Improvement, Methodology, Query or Suggestion.               
================================================================================

================================================================================
ALERT_241 Type_2 Indicator that the Structure Model may be Wrong or Deficient.
================================================================================
 The U(eq) value of an atom is compared with the average U(eq) for to           
 non-hydrogen atoms bonded to it. Large differences may indicate that the       
 wrong atom type was assigned (e.g. N instead of O).                            

================================================================================
ALERT_242 Type_2 Indicator that the Structure Model may be Wrong or Deficient.
================================================================================
 The U(eq) value of an atom is compared with the average U(eq) for              
 non-hydrogen atoms bonded to it. Large differences may indicate that the       
 wrong atom type was assigned (e.g. N instead of O). False alarms may           
 occur for terminal groups such as the t-butyl moiety.                          

================================================================================
ALERT_244 Type_4 Improvement, Methodology, Query or Suggestion.               
================================================================================
 The U(eq) value of an atom in the solvent or ion is compared with the average  
 U(eq) for non-hydrogen atoms bonded to it. Large differences may indicate      
 that the wrong atom type was assigned (e.g. N instead of O). False alarms may  
 occur for terminal groups such as the t-butyl moiety.                          

================================================================================
ALERT_300 Type_4 Improvement, Methodology, Query or Suggestion.               
================================================================================
 This site is expected to be fully occupied but has been constrained (e.g.      
 with a SHELXL FVAR variable) or fixed at a value less than 1.0. Please check   
 for incomplete (substitutional) disorder handling.                             

================================================================================
ALERT_301 Type_3 Indicator that the Structure Quality may be Low.             
================================================================================
 Atom sites that are not fully occupied are counted. A large fraction of        
 disordered atoms may be both a signal for serious structure analysis           
 problems or less reliable/interesting results.                                 

================================================================================
ALERT_302 Type_4 Improvement, Methodology, Query or Suggestion.               
================================================================================
 Atom sites that are not fully occupied are counted.                            

================================================================================
ALERT_311 Type_2 Indicator that the Structure Model may be Wrong or Deficient.
================================================================================
 This test reports on oxygen atoms (not full weight) that are not within        
 bonding distance to any other atom in the structure.                           
 A common reason may be that no hydrogen atoms are given for a water molecule.  

================================================================================
ALERT_342 Type_3 Indicator that the Structure Quality may be Low.             
================================================================================
 The average s.u. for X-Y bonds is tested (named bond-precision). X-Y will      
 generally be C-C bonds, unless there are none. In the last case the s.u.'s of  
 the lowest element numbers are considered (excluding hydrogen). There are      
 three test ranges: one for structures with the largest element Z < 20, one     
 for the largest Z in the range 20 to 39 and one for structures with Z(max) 40  
 or higher (_340, _341 and _342 respectively)                                   

================================================================================
ALERT_415 Type_2 Indicator that the Structure Model may be Wrong or Deficient.
================================================================================
 Short inter D-H..H-X contact. This might be a di-hydrogen bond of the type     
 B-H..H-O. See: Crabtree et al. Acc. Chem. Res. 1996, 29, 348-354.              

================================================================================
ALERT_417 Type_2 Indicator that the Structure Model may be Wrong or Deficient.
================================================================================
 Short non-bonding inter D-H..H-D contacts may be related to disordered or      
 misplaced H-atoms.                                                             
                                                                                
 Experience has shown that any intermolecular H...H separation of less than     
 1.8 Angstroms between unit-occupancy H atoms is a clear indicator that one     
 or both of these H atoms may be wrongly placed.                                

================================================================================
ALERT_432 Type_2 Indicator that the Structure Model may be Wrong or Deficient.
================================================================================
 This test raised an ALERT for short intermolecular contacts.                   
 In general, intermolecular contact distances should be not much smaller than   
 the sum of the associated van der Waals Radii. More often than not, such       
 short contacts can be a warning sign for errors. All short contacts should     
 therefore be examined in some detail. Interesting exceptions are carbonyl-     
 carbonyl interactions that often feature short O...C contacts (see Allen       
 et al. (1998) B54, 320-329, short NO2 O...O interactions and BF4(-) to         
 (aromatic) carbon contacts.

================================================================================
 This test reports the valency of an atom as predicted by the Valence           
 Bond Model. See:

 More explicit info on the calculations can be obtained by running the          
 calculations explicitly with the PLATON option BondValence.                    
                                                                                
 Note: The underlying theory is empirical and might not apply to the            
       case at hand (e.g. charged species).                                     

================================================================================
ALERT_860 Type_3 Indicator that the Structure Quality may be Low.             
================================================================================
 The use of restraints used in the refinement should be explained in            
 the write-up of a structure analysis.                                          
                                                                                
 It is also recommended to include the refinement instructions in the

 Please supply the proper info for _atom_site_solution_primary. Values must     
 be one of the following: difmap, vecmap, heavy, direct, geom, disper, isomor,

ALERT_910 Type_3 Indicator that the Structure Quality may be Low.             
================================================================================
 Possible causes: Experimental beamstop Theta(min) limit set too high; A large  
 unit-cell causing reflections effected by the beamstop. A possible technical   
 solution on CCD based equipment involves the collection of additional images   
 with the detector at a larger distance from the crystal with the beamstop      
 setting changed accordingly. Alternatively, a large number of low-order        
 'outlier' reflections might have been 'Omitted' deliberately from the (final)  
 least-squares refinement. The test is against the actual Theta(Min) of the     
 reflections in the *.fcf file. See the *.ckf file for details of the missing   
 reflections. Good quality low order reflections might be relevant for SQUEEZE  
 and similar solvent modelling refinement techniques.                           

================================================================================
ALERT_933 Type_2 Indicator that the Structure Model may be Wrong or Deficient.
================================================================================
 This ALERT reports on the number of 'OMIT h k l' records (Reflections          
 omitted from the least-squares refinement) in the CIF embedded .res file.      
 Generally, there should be a good reason for excluding those observed          
 experimental data point such as (partial) obscuration by the beam stop.

ALERT_954 Type_1 CIF Construction/Syntax Error, Inconsistent or Missing Data. 
================================================================================
 Reported (in the CIF) and Actual (in the FCF) Max(Kmax,-Kmin) values           
 differ by more than one unit. Check for data set truncation.

ALERT_973 Type_2 Indicator that the Structure Model may be Wrong or Deficient.
================================================================================
 Larger than expected residual density maximum on metal atom location.          
 This might be caused by unaccounted for twinning, wrongly assigned             
 atom types and other model errors.                                             
 Another cause may be a SHELXL 'DAMP 0 0' instruction for a non-converged       
 refinement.

ALERT_978 Type_2 Indicator that the Structure Model may be Wrong or Deficient.

 Difference density maps generally show residual densities on C-C bonds.        
 A significant number of those may indicate good data. Cases where this number  
 is zero should be investigated for a reason. The use of aspherical scattering  
 factors in the refinement model may be one.
