Explanation and Advice for the Reported ALERTS
================================================================================

================================================================================
ALERT_002 Type_2 Indicator that the Structure Model may be Wrong or Deficient.
================================================================================
 This ALERT reports the number of atomic sites that are flagged as distance     
 or angle restrained (D-Flag)                                                   

================================================================================
ALERT_003 Type_2 Indicator that the Structure Model may be Wrong or Deficient.
================================================================================
 This ALERT reports the number of non-H atoms that are flagged as handled       
 with Uiso or Uij restraints (U-Flag)                                           

================================================================================
ALERT_004 Type_5 Informative Message, Check.                                  
================================================================================
 This ALERT reports on polymeric networks and their dimensionality as found in  
 the crystal structure.                                                         
 Note: Polymeric structures can be legitimate or due to an erroneous            
 structure analysis.                                                            

================================================================================
ALERT_007 Type_5 Informative Message, Check.                                  
================================================================================
 It is standard practice to refine Hydrogen atoms on hetero atoms as proof of   
 their correct assignment.                                                      

================================================================================
ALERT_012 Type_1 CIF Construction/Syntax Error, Inconsistent or Missing Data. 
================================================================================
 The supplied CIF contains a '_shelx_res_file' record but not a valid           
 associated '_shelx_res_checksum' record. A valid pair of embedded .res and     
 .hkl files allows the automatic creation of a .fcf file with SHELXL20xy to be  
 used for a detailed analysis of the refinement result. A file is valid when    
 the calculated and reported checksums are identical. Only characters with an   
 ASCII value higher than 32 contribute to the checksum. An embedded .res file   
 might be broken, either due to tranfer errors or to deliberate or accidental   
 post-refinement editing of its content.                                        

================================================================================
ALERT_020 Type_3 Indicator that the Structure Quality may be Low.             
================================================================================
 The value of Rint (i.e. _diffrn_reflns_av_R_equivalents) should normally be    
 considerably less than 0.12 and in the order of magnitude of the reported      
 R-values. Rint may be relatively meaningless when based on a very limited      
 number of averaged data. Higher values should be accompanied by a suitable     
 explanation in the _publ_section_exptl_refinement section. However,            
 authors should first ensure that there are not overlooked problems             
 associated with the data or the space-group. Elevated values for               
 _diffrn_reflns_av_R_equivalents may be indicative of a need to recollect       
 the data from a crystal of higher quality or that there is a problem with      
 the data treatment. Consider the following                                     
 (a) The absorption corrections are inadequate or inappropriate.                
 (b) The overall quality of the data may be poor due to the crystal quality.    
 (c) The crystal is very weakly diffracting, so that a large proportion of      
     essentially "unobserved" reflections are being used in the refinement.     
     You should consider using a better crystal or a data collection at         
     low temperature and/or, if the compound is organic, using Cu radiation.    
 (d) You are working in the wrong crystal system or Laue group.                 
 (e) You have only a very small number of equivalent reflections, which         
     may lead to artificially high values of _diffrn_reflns_av_R_equivalents    
                                                                                
 Note that if _diffrn_reflns_av_sigmaI/netI is also large, the quality          
 of the data should be considered to be suspect.                                

================================================================================
ALERT_033 Type_4 Improvement, Methodology, Query or Suggestion.               
================================================================================
 Check the relevance/validity of the absolute structure determination. Please   
 refer to Flack,H.D. & Bernardinelli, G. (1999) Acta Cryst. A55, 908-915 and    
 (2000) J. Appl. Cryst., 33, 1143-1148. A value of the Flack parameter that     
 deviates significantly from zero  (taking into account the associated s.u.)    
 might indicate that the absolute structure should be inverted in case of a     
 value closer to 1.0 than to zero. A value close to 0.5 may be indicative of    
 an inversion twin or a missed centre of inversion. For valid absolute          
 structure assignments, abs(x) should be less than 2 * s.u., with s.u. < 0.04.  
 For enantiopure compounds, s.u. should be less than 0.1.                       

================================================================================
ALERT_072 Type_2 Indicator that the Structure Model may be Wrong or Deficient.
================================================================================
 The first parameter on the SHELXL weighting line has an exceptionally          
 large value. This may indicate either improper reflection s.u.'s or            
 an unresolved problem such as missed twinning.                                 

================================================================================
ALERT_090 Type_3 Indicator that the Structure Quality may be Low.             
================================================================================
 The data/parameter ratio should in general be higher than 8 for a quality      
 determination for a structure containing heavy atoms with ZMAX greater         
 than 17. This ratio can be improved by not refining C-H parameters other       
 than riding on their carrier atom.                                             

================================================================================
ALERT_172 Type_4 Improvement, Methodology, Query or Suggestion.               
================================================================================
 The use of DFIX record(s) should be documented in the experimental section     
 of the associated publication.                                                 

================================================================================

================================================================================
 The use of DANG record(s) should be documented in the experimental section     
 of the associated publication.                                                 

================================================================================
ALERT_174 Type_4 Improvement, Methodology, Query or Suggestion.               
================================================================================
 The use of FLAT record(s) should be documented in the experimental section     
 of the associated publication.                                                 

================================================================================
ALERT_176 Type_4 Improvement, Methodology, Query or Suggestion.               
================================================================================
 The use of SADI record(s) in the SHELXL .res file should be documented in the  
 experimental section of the associated publication.                            

================================================================================
ALERT_177 Type_4 Improvement, Methodology, Query or Suggestion.               
================================================================================
 The use of DELU record(s) in the SHELXL .res file should be documented in the  
 experimental section of the associated publication.                            

================================================================================
ALERT_178 Type_4 Improvement, Methodology, Query or Suggestion.               
================================================================================
 The use of SIMU record(s) in the SHELXL .res file should be documented in the  
 experimental section of the associated publication.                            

================================================================================
ALERT_186 Type_4 Improvement, Methodology, Query or Suggestion.               
================================================================================
 The use of ISOR record(s) in the SHELXL .res file should be documented in the  
 experimental section of the associated publication.                            

================================================================================
ALERT_232 Type_2 Indicator that the Structure Model may be Wrong or Deficient.
================================================================================
 The components of the anisotropic displacement parameters along chemical       
 bonds are assumed to be equal in magnitude. Large differences might            
 indicate contamination of these parameters with other (unresolved) effects     
 such as (substitutional) disorder, model or data errors and/or                 
 over-refinement. Atomic sites assigned the wrong scattering type (e.g. Ag      
 versus Br) should generate 'problem signals' with this test. Data sets         
 corrected for absorption effects with DELREF techniques (e.g. DIFABS, SHELXA,  
 XABS2) often show large DELU values for bonds involving the heaviest atom.     
                                                                                
 A special case are M-C=O type of systems that generally show significant       
 differences for the M-C bond. See D.Braga & T.F. Koetzle (1988), Acta Cryst.   
 B44, 151-155).                                                                 
                                                                                
 Note: The original 'Hirshfeld-test' was defined in absolute terms (see         
 F.L.Hirshfeld, Acta Cryst. (1976). A32, 239-244). The current test is with     
 reference to the associated standard uncertainty.                              
                                                                                
 Note: The 'Hirshfeld-test' ALERTS are suppressed for polymeric or disordered   
 structures.                                                                    

================================================================================
ALERT_241 Type_2 Indicator that the Structure Model may be Wrong or Deficient.
================================================================================
 The U(eq) value of an atom is compared with the average U(eq) for to           
 non-hydrogen atoms bonded to it. Large differences may indicate that the       
 wrong atom type was assigned (e.g. N instead of O).                            

================================================================================
ALERT_242 Type_2 Indicator that the Structure Model may be Wrong or Deficient.
================================================================================
 The U(eq) value of an atom is compared with the average U(eq) for              
 non-hydrogen atoms bonded to it. Large differences may indicate that the       
 wrong atom type was assigned (e.g. N instead of O). False alarms may           
 occur for terminal groups such as the t-butyl moiety.                          

================================================================================
ALERT_244 Type_4 Improvement, Methodology, Query or Suggestion.               
================================================================================
 The U(eq) value of an atom in the solvent or ion is compared with the average  
 U(eq) for non-hydrogen atoms bonded to it. Large differences may indicate      
 that the wrong atom type was assigned (e.g. N instead of O). False alarms may  
 occur for terminal groups such as the t-butyl moiety.                          

================================================================================
ALERT_260 Type_2 Indicator that the Structure Model may be Wrong or Deficient.
================================================================================
 A large average Ueq value for a residue may indicate refinement with a too     
 high (possibly fixed) population parameter value.                              

================================================================================
ALERT_300 Type_4 Improvement, Methodology, Query or Suggestion.               
================================================================================
 This site is expected to be fully occupied but has been constrained (e.g.      
 with a SHELXL FVAR variable) or fixed at a value less than 1.0. Please check   
 for incomplete (substitutional) disorder handling.                             

================================================================================
ALERT_301 Type_3 Indicator that the Structure Quality may be Low.             
================================================================================
 Atom sites that are not fully occupied are counted. A large fraction of        
 disordered atoms may be both a signal for serious structure analysis           
 problems or less reliable/interesting results.                                 

================================================================================
ALERT_302 Type_4 Improvement, Methodology, Query or Suggestion.

 Atom sites that are not fully occupied are counted.                            

================================================================================
ALERT_342 Type_3 Indicator that the Structure Quality may be Low.             
================================================================================
 The average s.u. for X-Y bonds is tested (named bond-precision). X-Y will      
 generally be C-C bonds, unless there are none. In the last case the s.u.'s of  
 the lowest element numbers are considered (excluding hydrogen). There are      
 three test ranges: one for structures with the largest element Z < 20, one     
 for the largest Z in the range 20 to 39 and one for structures with Z(max) 40  
 or higher (_340, _341 and _342 respectively)                                   

================================================================================
ALERT_367 Type_2 Indicator that the Structure Model may be Wrong or Deficient.
================================================================================
 Large deviations from generally accepted values may indicate model problems,   
 over refinement etc. Default C?-C? = 1.50 Ang. (X-Ray) value from              
 Ladd & Palmer, Structure Determination by Xray Crystallography (1985).         

================================================================================
ALERT_410 Type_2 Indicator that the Structure Model may be Wrong or Deficient.
================================================================================
 Short intramolecular contacts may arise when H-atoms are in (false)            
 calculated positions. Short intramolecular contacts may also be a sign for a   
 false structure with the molecule sitting on a site with improper site         
 symmetry (e.g. '2' instead of '-1') which may happen when a lattice            
 translation is missed. Short contacts are defined using a van der Waals        
 radius of 1.2 Angstrom. For intramolecular contacts alerts are generated       
 for contacts less than 2.0 Angstrom.                                           

================================================================================
ALERT_414 Type_2 Indicator that the Structure Model may be Wrong or Deficient.
================================================================================
 Short intra D-H..H-X contact. This might be a di-hydrogen bond of the type     
 B-H..H-O.  See Crabtree et al. Acc. Chem. Res. 1996, 29, 348-354.              

================================================================================
ALERT_420 Type_2 Indicator that the Structure Model may be Wrong or Deficient.
================================================================================
 Potential hydrogen bond donors are checked for the presence of suitable        
 acceptors using commonly used (Jeffrey) H-bond criteria. As a general rule     
 there should be an acceptor for each donor. Exceptions are very rare for O-H   
 and more common for -NH and -NH2. A common error is an -OH with Hydrogen atom  
 on a calculated position with O-H pointing in the wrong direction.             

================================================================================
ALERT_432 Type_2 Indicator that the Structure Model may be Wrong or Deficient.
================================================================================
 This test raised an ALERT for short intermolecular contacts.                   
 In general, intermolecular contact distances should be not much smaller than   
 the sum of the associated van der Waals Radii. More often than not, such       
 short contacts can be a warning sign for errors. All short contacts should     
 therefore be examined in some detail. Interesting exceptions are carbonyl-     
 carbonyl interactions that often feature short O...C contacts (see Allen       
 et al. (1998) B54, 320-329, short NO2 O...O interactions and BF4(-) to         
 (aromatic) carbon contacts.

 D-H..A angles without s.u. should be rounded to integer values for             
 publication purposes (Required for Acta Cryst.).                               

================================================================================
ALERT_779 Type_4 Improvement, Methodology, Query or Suggestion.               
================================================================================
 Possibly erroneous (Bond)angle less than 45 degree. The angle might be         
 considered for elimination from the CIF when irrelevant. This ALERT can        
 also be triggered when the assigned occupancy factors are incorrect.

ALERT_860 Type_3 Indicator that the Structure Quality may be Low.             
================================================================================
 The use of restraints used in the refinement should be explained in            
 the write-up of a structure analysis.                                          
                                                                                
 It is also recommended to include the refinement instructions in the

ALERT_883 Type_1 CIF Construction/Syntax Error, Inconsistent or Missing Data. 
================================================================================
 Please supply the proper info for _atom_site_solution_primary. Values must     
 be one of the following: difmap, vecmap, heavy, direct, geom, disper, isomor,  
 notdet, dual, iterative, other.

ALERT_906 Type_3 Indicator that the Structure Quality may be Low.             
================================================================================
 Scale Factors (i.e. K = Mean[Fo**2] / Mean [Fc**2]) for selected groups of     
 reflections, as listed in the Analysis of Variance Section #7 of the FCF       
 validation report, are expected to have a value of about 1.000. Strong         
 deviations should be investigated, acted upon or explained. (see also SHELXL   
 manual). For details see the Analysis-of-Variance Section in the '.ckf' file.  

================================================================================
ALERT_908 Type_2 Indicator that the Structure Model may be Wrong or Deficient.
================================================================================
 A low maximum percentage of reflections with I > 2*s(I) may indicate:          
 1 - Missed translation symmetry. E.g. all reflections hkl weak                 
     for l = 2n +1                                                              
 2 - Pseudo-merohedral twinning, index > 1. (e.g. non-spacegroup                
     extinctions.                                                               
 3 - Very weak observed data.                                                   

================================================================================
ALERT_910 Type_3 Indicator that the Structure Quality may be Low.             
================================================================================
 Possible causes: Experimental beamstop Theta(min) limit set too high; A large  
 unit-cell causing reflections effected by the beamstop. A possible technical   
 solution on CCD based equipment involves the collection of additional images   
 with the detector at a larger distance from the crystal with the beamstop      
 setting changed accordingly. Alternatively, a large number of low-order        
 'outlier' reflections might have been 'Omitted' deliberately from the (final)  
 least-squares refinement. The test is against the actual Theta(Min) of the     
 reflections in the *.fcf file. See the *.ckf file for details of the missing   
 reflections. Good quality low order reflections might be relevant for SQUEEZE  
 and similar solvent modelling refinement techniques.                           

================================================================================
ALERT_911 Type_3 Indicator that the Structure Quality may be Low.             
================================================================================
 Possible causes: Missing cusp of data (due to rotation about one axis),        
 deleted (overflow) reflections or improper strategy (orthorhombic for          
 monoclinic crystal etc.) See the .ckf file for details.                        

================================================================================
ALERT_912 Type_4 Improvement, Methodology, Query or Suggestion.               
================================================================================
 Possible causes: Missing cusp of data (due to rotation about one axis),        
 deleted (overflow) reflections or improper strategy (orthorhombic for          
 monoclinic crystal etc.) See the .ckf file for details.                        

================================================================================
ALERT_933 Type_2 Indicator that the Structure Model may be Wrong or Deficient.
================================================================================
 This ALERT reports on the number of 'OMIT h k l' records (Reflections          
 omitted from the least-squares refinement) in the CIF embedded .res file.      
 Generally, there should be a good reason for excluding those observed          
 experimental data point such as (partial) obscuration by the beam stop.        

================================================================================
ALERT_973 Type_2 Indicator that the Structure Model may be Wrong or Deficient.
================================================================================
 Larger than expected residual density maximum on metal atom location.          
 This might be caused by unaccounted for twinning, wrongly assigned             
 atom types and other model errors.                                             
 Another cause may be a SHELXL 'DAMP 0 0' instruction for a non-converged       
 refinement.                                                                    

================================================================================
ALERT_977 Type_2 Indicator that the Structure Model may be Wrong or Deficient.
================================================================================
 Negative density found in a difference density map at a H-atom location.       
 A reason might be an incorrect AFIX instruction.                               

================================================================================
ALERT_978 Type_2 Indicator that the Structure Model may be Wrong or Deficient.
================================================================================
 Difference density maps generally show residual densities on C-C bonds.        
 A significant number of those may indicate good data. Cases where this number  
 is zero should be investigated for a reason. The use of aspherical scattering  
 factors in the refinement model may be one.
